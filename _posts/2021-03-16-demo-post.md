Hello, everyone. This is my first blog. I use this blog to record how I config local jekyll env and this blog.

# Jekyll Env Config

System: macOS 

1. Install [homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)

2. Install ruby with `brew install ruby `

3. As promoted by brew, add ruby to `PATH`. For zsh, the command is `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`

4. Reopen zsh shell

5. Install bundle `gem install bundle`

6. Go to the root folder of your blog, create 'GemFile'

   ```ruby
   source "https://rubygems.org"
   
   gem "jekyll"
   gem "jekyll-paginate"
   gem "webrick", "~> 1.7"
   ```

    

6. Execuate `bundle install`

   Your jekyll environment is set.

   You can test if it works.
